The functions used to compute values unique to each probability distribution can be found
in the multi\_mle module.  Scripts used in the experiments can be found in the main repository directory
and are named "runtime_analysis.py" and "naive_bayes.py".

Code on the publication branch will remain as described in the publication.  Code
in the main branch may be updated from the publication code.
